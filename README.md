# ScreenPin

ScreenPin is a utility add-on for browsers which adds so-called "pins" on different locations in a webpage.

ScreenPin is aimed to be developed as a utility tool which can solve various problems for web-users in situations like:

A user reading a webpage for the sole purpose of copying some bunch of data from various non-contigous parts of the webpage, the user can use ScreenPin and place the "pins" on parts of the webpage that the user requires and then can go through the entire webpage and copy the entire data.

Extended examples, usage and target audience can be online-newspaper readers, last day exams preparations and many more. Maneuvering across long documentation by pinning can make reading and accessing wanted information extremely fast.

On adding the extension, when you right click anywhere in the webpage, an additional option of ScreePin called "Add pin" will be added which will pin your posititon which can then be accessed anytime
